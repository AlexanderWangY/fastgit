# fastgit

This is a work in progress.

Are you tired of git adding, then committing, and then having to retype it all again?

Or maybe you hate creating a new branch, then having to set and upstream and push it?

Or you might be a beginner with merging/rebasing and it confuses you?

Or maybe even the constant git cloning and npm installing/pip install requirementing is getting to you?

Fastgit is here to cimplify the tedious journey of using git!

Wanted features/TODO:

$ fastgit clone <URL> --node or --pip or a combination

$ fastgit branch -b <name> (This automatically creates an upstream and pushes)

$ fastgit commit -m 'message' (this adds and commits)
